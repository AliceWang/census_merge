This US Census shapefile/population data merging program is
Copyright (C) 2009 Joshua Justice
Licensed under the GNU GPL, version 2, or at your option any later version.

To use this program, there are two options.

One is batch merging of all shapefiles/population data files-
with or without racial demographics data-
in order to simplify working on all states at once for some later use.

This is done by downloading and unzipping all the relevant files from the US Census website:
http://www2.census.gov/cgi-bin/shapefiles/national-files
for the shape files. Each state should be in its own folder after unzipping.
http://ftp2.census.gov/census_2000/datasets/redistricting_file--pl_94-171/
for the population files, preserving the existing directory structure and unzipping there.
Bash syntax to do this is to cd to the directory containing all state files, then:
    ls | while read dir; do cd $dir; unzip \*.zip; cd ..; done 

Once that is done, simply run the .jar file with the VM size increased
(so that there will be enough space to operate on whole states).
As an example:
    java -jar Merger.jar -Xms1g -Xmx4g
This sets the minimum VM size to 1 gigabyte and the maximum to 4 gigabytes.
If this is not enough, increase the maximum size.

If you wish to only merge one state or even just a county,
there is currently no way to do that without using this as a library.

For information on that, see the Javadoc.
