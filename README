This US Census shapefile/population data merging program is
Copyright (C) 2009 Joshua Justice, licensed under the GNU GPL.

To use this program, there are two options.

One is batch merging of all shapefiles/population data files-
with or without racial demographics data-
in order to simplify working on all states at once for some later use.

This is done by downloading and unzipping all the relevant files from the US Census website:
http://www2.census.gov/cgi-bin/shapefiles/national-files
for the shape files. Each state should be in its own folder after unzipping.
http://ftp2.census.gov/census_2000/datasets/redistricting_file--pl_94-171/
for the population files, preserving the existing directory structure and unzipping there.
Bash syntax to do this is to cd to the directory containing all state files, then:
    ls | while read dir; do cd $dir; unzip \*.zip; cd ..; done 

Once that is done, simply run the .jar file with the VM size increased
(so that there will be enough space to operate on whole states).
As an example:
    java -jar Merger.jar -Xms1g -Xmx4g
This sets the minimum VM size to 1 gigabyte and the maximum to 4 gigabytes.
If this is not enough, increase the maximum size.

If you wish to only merge one state or even just a county,
there is currently no way to do that without using this as a library.

For information on that, see the Javadoc.
